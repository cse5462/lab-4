## TicTacToe Player 1
> By: Conner Graham

### DESCRIPTION <a name="description-p1"></a>
This lab contains a program called "tictactoeP1" which sets up
the first player (server) of a simple net-enabled TicTacToe game.
This server sets up a connection endpoint for other players to
connect to sequentially connects to any waiting players,
initializes a game of TicTacToe when a player connects, and then
starts playing the game sending moves to the other player and
waiting for the other players moves in response until a winner is
found or the game is a draw. The specific tasks the server
performs are as follows:
- Create and bind server socket from user provided port
- Print server info and listen for connections
- Accept TCP STREAM connection from waiting client
- Initialize new game of TicTacToe
- Play game of TicTacToe with connected client
- Terminate the connection to the client once game ends

If the number of arguments is incorrect remote port is
invalid, the program prints appropriate messages and
shows how to correctly invoke the program. 

### USAGE <a name="usage-p1"></a>
Start the TicTacToe P1 Server with the command...
```sh
$ tictactoeP1 <local-port>
```

If any of the argument strings contain whitespace, those
arguments will need to be enclosed in quotes.

### ASSUMPTIONS <a name="assumptions-p1"></a>
- It is assumed that no more than 5 players will be trying to play
  at a given time.
- It is assumed that the Player 1 (server) will terminate the server
  when they are done playing, in which case clients will need to
  find another serevr to connect to if they sich to play.

## TicTacToe Player 2
> By: Ben Nagel

### DESCRIPTION <a name="description-p2"></a>
This lab contains a program called "tictactoeP2" which creates and sets up a byte transfer protocal client. This client connects to the specified server( IP address and port), reads in a byte from the server and sends a byte back. This process continues until a winner or a tie has been reached.

The specific tasks the client performs are as
follows:
- Create server socket from user provided IP/port
- Establish TCP STREAM connection to remote server
- Perform byte transfer over the connection
- Terminate the connection to the server

### USAGE <a name="usage-p2"></a>
Start the TicTacToe P2 Client with the command...
```sh
$ tictactoeP2 <remote-IP> <local-port>
```

If any of the argument strings contain whitespace, those
arguments will need to be enclosed in quotes.

### ASSUMPTIONS <a name="assumptions-p2"></a>
- Client send and recieves characters as 1 byte.
- The characters sent are ASCII 
- The spaces on the tictactoe board are 1-9
- Player 1 is the "server": they are the one who calls bind()   
- Player 1 goes first
- Player 2 is the "client": they are the one who calls connect() 
- On any errors, close the connection 
- It is assumed that the IP addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 are invalid remote server addresses to connect to as they are reserved values.
